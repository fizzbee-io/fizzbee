# Example 0004: Init Action Details
# Demonstrates how Init action initializes state variables
# All variables defined in Init become part of the state space
# NOTE: Unbounded state space - see 0002 for details on state explosion

action Init:
    # These variables become state variables
    counter = 0
    status = "ready"
    items = []

atomic action AddItem:
    items.append(counter)
    counter = counter + 1
