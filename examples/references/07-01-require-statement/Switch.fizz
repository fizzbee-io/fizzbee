# Example 0026: Require Statement
# Using require for guard clauses
# Demonstrates: require statement, explicit enabling conditions

action Init:
    state = "OFF"

atomic action TurnOn:
    # Require acts as guard - action disabled if false
    require state == "OFF"
    state = "ON"

atomic action TurnOff:
    require state == "ON"
    state = "OFF"

# Require immediately disables action if condition is false
# More explicit than using if with return
