# Example 0067: Idempotent Operations Pattern
# Operations that can be safely retried
# Demonstrates: idempotency, deduplication, request IDs

action Init:
    processed_ids = set()
    counter = 0
    requests = 0

atomic action SendRequest:
    require requests < 3

    request_id = requests
    requests = requests + 1

    # Process if not already processed (idempotent)
    if request_id not in processed_ids:
        processed_ids.add(request_id)
        counter = counter + 1

atomic action RetryRequest:
    require requests > 0

    # Retry with existing request ID
    request_id = any range(requests)

    # Idempotent: no effect if already processed
    if request_id not in processed_ids:
        processed_ids.add(request_id)
        counter = counter + 1

# Safety: counter never exceeds unique requests
always assertion IdempotencyInvariant:
    return counter <= requests

# Safety: processed IDs match counter
always assertion ProcessedCorrectly:
    return counter == len(processed_ids)

atomic action NoOp:
    if requests >= 3:
        pass
