# Example 0003: Multiple Actions
# Multiple independent actions operating on the same state
# Demonstrates: how multiple actions create state transitions
# NOTE: Unbounded state space - see 0002 for details on state explosion

action Init:
    counter = 0

atomic action Increment:
    counter = counter + 1

atomic action Decrement:
    counter = counter - 1
