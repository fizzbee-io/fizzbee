# Example 0001: No-op Action
# The simplest FizzBee spec with a single action that does nothing meaningful
# Demonstrates: basic action syntax and minimal state initialization

action Init:
    counter = 0

atomic action NoOp:
    # pass statement unconditionally enables the action
    # without it, the action would be disabled (no state change)
    pass
