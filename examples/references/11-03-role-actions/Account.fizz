# Example 0048: Role Actions
# Actions within roles
# Demonstrates: role actions, implicit self

role Account:
    action Init:
        self.balance = 0

    # Role actions don't take parameters (like top-level actions)
    # self is implicit (no need to declare)
    action Deposit:
        require self.balance < 50

        self.balance = self.balance + 10

    action Withdraw:
        require self.balance >= 10

        self.balance = self.balance - 10

action Init:
    account = Account()

# Role actions are called by the model checker
# Just like top-level actions
# The model checker explores all enabled role actions

atomic action NoOp:
    pass
